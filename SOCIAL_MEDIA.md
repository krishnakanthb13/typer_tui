🚀 Exciting news! I've just released Typer TUI v0.0.4 – a minimal, offline, and distraction-free terminal-based typing test built with Python and Textual.

As developers, we spend most of our time in the terminal. Why switch to a browser to warm up your hands or test your speed? Typer TUI brings the challenge right to your shell.

Key Highlights:
✅ 12 Typing Modes (Easy, Medium, Hard, Python, CLI Commands, Quotes, Zen, and more!)
✅ Real-time WPM & Accuracy stats
✅ Persistent session history to track your growth
✅ 100% Keyboard centric navigation
✅ Cross-platform launchers (Windows/Linux/Mac)

**Post Title**: [Show Reddit] I built a minimal, offline typing speed test for the terminal (TUI)

**Body**:
Hey everyone!

I wanted a way to practice my typing speed without opening a browser or dealing with ads/trackers. So I built **Typer TUI** – a Python-based terminal app using the Textual framework.

It’s offline-first, lightweight, and designed specifically for developers.

**What's inside v0.0.4:**
*   **12 Modes**: From standard words to Python code snippets and terminal commands.
*   **Progress Tracking**: Automatically logs your stats to a local JSON file.
*   **Keyboard Centric**: No mouse needed. Use arrows and hotkeys to navigate.
*   **Privacy First**: No internet required, no data leaves your machine.

I'm releasing this under **GPL v3**. I'd love to hear what you think or what other modes you'd like to see added!
