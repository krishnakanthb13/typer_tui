Breathe in calm, breathe out chaos.
The present moment is all we ever have.
Let go of what you cannot control.
Still water runs deep.
Be like water: formless, shapeless, adaptable.
In silence, find your strength.
The quieter you become, the more you can hear.
Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.
Every moment is a fresh beginning.
Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
The obstacle is the path.
What we think, we become.
Be still. Be present. Be here.
The river flows because it knows no barriers.
